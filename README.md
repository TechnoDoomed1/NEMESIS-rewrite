# NEMESIS-rewrite
Pet project of mine where I create a new cryptosystem (polyalphabetic substitution on a byte level). Done on my 3rd year of my Math's degree. NEMESIS works by having two passwords that are combined to create a very long keystream to encode each individual byte. This is the more recent Cython version.
